### TagBuddyAI — Auto-meme-coin from IG/FB tags

When your Instagram or Facebook account is tagged in a post, TagBuddyAI automatically creates a Pump.fun token on Solana, using the post/profile context to propose name and description, then replies back to the tagger with the Pump.fun link and the contract (mint) address.

### What it does

- **Listens to tags**: Subscribes to Instagram/Facebook webhooks to detect when your account is tagged in a photo or post.
- **Derives token metadata**: Generates a name/symbol/description from the tagged post and profile context (configurable).
- **Creates a token on Pump.fun**: Mints/initializes a token via Pump.fun on Solana using your configured keypair and RPC.
- **Replies automatically**: Comments or DMs the tagger with an explorer link and the on‑chain contract address.
